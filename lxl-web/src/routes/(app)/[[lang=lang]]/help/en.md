## Help and information

### General Information about the Search Service

What is completely new with this beta version is that it reads data without delay directly from the Libris catalog and builds on the advantages brought by the new information model. This means, among other things, that edits in the cataloging client (on QA) are immediately visible in the search service, but also that some text may appear more technical than before. This is something we will continue to work on to improve.

### Information on how the search works:

In addition to standard free text search, you can also write more advanced search queries directly in the search box, for example, AUTHOR:Rowling, TITEL:Seagull or YEAR:2000, and search operators, such as AND to include all search terms or NOT to exclude search terms.

To search for phrases or word combinations, enclose the search terms in quotation marks, for example, "seven seasick sailors". Note that this also needs to be done for titles or search strings with a colon “:” in them, as this character is currently interpreted as an operator for targeted search.

To include multiple word forms, truncate with an asterisk, for example, searching for cultur* will return hits where the words culture and cultural are included.

### Narrow down the search results with the following filters:

<b>Type</b> for material type<br>
<b>Carrier</b> type for type of storage or playback/display<br>
<b>Genre/form</b> for description of what the object is<br>
<b>Language</b> for the language used in the object<br>
<b>Year published</b> for the year the object was published<br>
<b>Library</b> for libraries that have the object in their collections<br>
<b>Bibliography</b> for listings of materials within a specific area, such as a person, subject, or geographical area<br>
<b>Subject</b> for subject terms describing the object<br>
<b>Contribution</b> for persons or organizations that created or contributed to the creation of the object<br>
<b>Intended audience</b> for the intended audience of the object<br>
<b>Other</b> for including records from electronic legal deposit and upcoming publications as well as narrowing down to resources with thumbnails

When one or more filters are selected, the “Edit” button appears, allowing you to edit the search string with operators.

Note that not all content in Libris is described with all filter types. The way material is described in Libris has varied over time. Therefore, you may need to perform several complementary searches or adjust the filtering to capture relevant objects. The filters display a maximum of 100 options; you can further narrow down the search to bring up fewer results.

### Information displayed in a detailed view of the object:

The detailed view shows detailed and descriptive information about the object as well as related information.

Print = a printed resource<br>
Electronic = an electronic resource<br>
Instance = a resource where the exact type is not defined (often because the record was added to Libris through an automated flow)<br>

We are simultaneously working on improved categorization of materials, which we will test in the future; more information about this will come.

If the material is available in multiple editions, the editions are listed with the newest first. By clicking the arrow for each edition, detailed information about the respective edition and the libraries that hold that specific edition is displayed.

In some cases, there is a link to the material online. Some of these are freely available to everyone, while others require you to be a borrower at a library that has a license to show the material.

By using the Copy link to edition function, you can copy and save a direct link to the edition.
