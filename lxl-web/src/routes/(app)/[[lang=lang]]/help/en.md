### General information

Use Libris to explore, evaluate and navigate Swedish library collections. You can find both physical and digital material in the form of literature, music, magazines, sheet music, images, games, posters, manuscripts and maps, etc. You can also see which libraries have what or whether the material is freely available online, for example.

### Using the search function

A lot of material can be found with a simple free text search in the search box. The hits can be sorted according to the categories found in the drop-down menu on the right of the page. The default sorting is “Relevance“ which is calculated according to how well the search query matches the result and a few other variables such as quality of the description and accessibility.

### Phrase search

To search for phrases, the search terms are placed in quotation marks, for example `“seven seasick sailors”`. Please note that this also needs to be done for the time being for titles or search strings that contain a colon “:“ because that character is currently interpreted as an operator for targeted search - this is something that needs to be addressed.

### Truncation

The asterisk is used for truncation when you want to include more word forms. For example, searching for `cultural heritage*` returns hits that include the words "cultural heritage", "cultural heritage" and "cultural heritage institutions".

### Masking

If you want to search for words that may have varied spellings, it is possible to mask them using question marks, usually to include different spelling variants. For example, `organi?ation` returns matches for "organisation" and "organization" , i.e. both British and American spellings.

### To refine a search/search by attribute

To refine the search within a property, you can either type, for example, `title: " gulliver's travels"` or simply click the `Title:` button and then fill in the title in the "pill" that appears in the search box. This corresponds to the function of searching in the "Title/words in title" field in the old service's extended search form. It is possible to combine several such "pills" to further limit the search query. The pills that are currently supported are `Author/source:`, `Title:`, `Language:`, `Subject:`, `Year:`.

### Search suggestions

When you type in the search field, you will be presented with suggestions for either direct matches that appear to match your search query or other features that can help refine or narrow your search query, such as adding an author to the search query if you start typing a person's name, subject word, or organization. These suggestions can then be either navigated to directly or added as part of the search query.

### Exploration or delimitation with filters/facets

One way to explore the catalog or narrow your search is to click on the filters (or facets) in the left column. The filters correspond to the information available in your search results. To make it easier to find the filters, they can be sorted individually by number of hits, a-z or z-a. Active filters are displayed directly in the search box.

- A handy feature is that you can search through all visible filters in the search box above the filters . Please note that only the filters that are “loaded” for the search query can be searched through, and these are also limited to the 100 most common for each filter category. This means that if more than 100 subject words are represented in the search result, only the first 100 will be displayed. Narrow down the search further to get below this limit if any subject words are missing.

### More advanced exploration

In addition to the standard free text search and the visible filters, there is also the possibility of constructing more advanced search queries. Additional properties that can be filtered on or searched within are listed at [id.kb.se/vocab](https://id.kb.se/vocab/) (press the Properties button). Some common properties will have simpler labels to make it faster to enter common search queries by hand. You can already use the short form `YEAR:` to search for material with a specified publication year or year range. In the edit mode, there is also support for the search operators `AND` , `OR` and `NOT`.

- More extensive documentation on this is in progress and will be published when complete.

### Example searches

Here are some examples that can be entered as search queries directly into the search box. Click on the different examples to open them in the search service.

English and French works matching the search phrase “Pippi Longstocking” published after 2002:<br>
[`Pippi Longstocking language: (English OR French) YEAR>2002`](<https://beta.libris-qa.kb.se/find?_i=pippi+l%C3%A5ngstrump&_q=pippi+l%C3%A5ngstrump+SPR%C3%85K:(engelska%20OR%20franska)&_limit=20&_x=advanced>)

Material published between 2010 and 2024, which is in Swedish and has [dragons](https://id.kb.se/term/sao/Drakar) as a topic:<br>
[`language:swedish YEAR>2010 YEAR<=2024 topic:"sao:Dragons"`](https://beta.libris-qa.kb.se/find?_i=&_q=SPR%C3%85K:svenska+%C3%85R%3E2010+%C3%85R%3C%3D2024+subject:%22sao:Drakar%22&_limit=20&_x=advanced)

### Details view/resource page

Each item in the catalog can be accessed by either clicking on it in the hit list, or by entering its unique URL into the browser's address bar. Here you will find a more detailed description of the item along with information related to it. This applies not only to materials but also to subject words, people, roles, etc.

If the material is published in multiple editions, these are displayed in a list sorted by publication date. By clicking on the arrow for each edition, more detailed information about it is displayed, as well as the libraries that have the specific edition.

In some cases, the detail view contains one or more links to access the material online. Some materials are freely available to everyone, while others require you to be a borrower at a library that has a license to view the material.

### Find at the library

As a rule, all the material you find in Libris is available at least in one library in Sweden, but often in several. To see which libraries have a material, there are buttons that show the number of libraries that have the material in the search results list, on the resource page and in cases where there are several different editions also next to either edition . When you click on one of these buttons, a box opens in which you can navigate among the relevant libraries and, in cases where our systems are interconnected, see the current loan status of the material.

### Favorite library

You can search for and set a number of libraries as your favorite libraries, which can then be used as a filter among other filters on the search page. If a material is available at a specified favorite library, these libraries will also be displayed at the top of the loan box.
In some cases, the detail view contains one or more links to access the material online. Some material is freely available to everyone, while others require you to be a borrower at a library that has a license to display the material.
