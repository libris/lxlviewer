# Welcome to open beta!

Here you can follow the development of the new libris.kb.se, try out new features and provide feedback. The work is done iteratively so improvements and new features are added as they happen. [News about libris development](https://www.kb.se/for-bibliotekssektorn/nytt-fran-kb.html?sv.target=12.5b5507eb18cedffd1a434463&sv.12.5b5507eb18cedffd1a434463.route=/news&keywords=Libris&page=1) is published on kb.se.

In Libris you will find information about what is available to access in Swedish libraries. [The initiative's](https://beta.libris.kb.se/en/about) ultimate goal is to replace today's search service and take steps forward in technical development for the library sector.

_Please note: The beta version contains a static copy of the Libris catalog that is updated periodically, meaning you won't necessarily be able to compare search results between the services, although it often is possible._
